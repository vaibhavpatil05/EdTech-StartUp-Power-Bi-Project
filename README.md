# EdTech-StartUp-Power-Bi-Project

As a data analyst working for an EdTech startup, this project involved analyzing collected data from various EdTech websites to uncover valuable insights about recorded lectures. These insights aim to guide strategic decisions on course offerings, content optimization, and user engagement. The analysis was conducted using Power BI, and an interactive dashboard was created to visualize the findings effectively.

## Overview

The goal of this project was to help an EdTech startup identify areas for improvement and opportunities for growth in their recorded lecture services. By cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing the data, I provided actionable insights using an interactive Power BI dashboard.

## Problem Statement

The EdTech startup wanted to:
- Understand trends in course types across categories.
- Identify high-demand categories and subcategories.
- Analyze viewer engagement metrics (views, languages, subtitles).
- Highlight the most commonly taught skills and align courses with market trends.
- Identify top-performing instructors and optimize course durations.

## Key Insights

1. **Course Type Analysis**: Identified the distribution of courses, specializations, and certifications across categories.
2. **Viewer Engagement**:
   - Average number of views by category, subcategory, and language.
   - Top categories based on user preferences.
3. **Skill Analysis**: Highlighted commonly taught skills relevant to todayâ€™s job market.
